Becca, why was being an Israel Fellow important to you?  (Part of my application)

Background:

I am a first generation Mexican-American that grew up in a Judeo-Christian household. My parents emigrated from Mexico and lived most of their life serving others (they did a lot of missionary/service work to low-income communities in Mexico and Canada). Because of my parents’ Christian background, I was raised with all the old testament stories and principles, so I am familiar with the Genesis accounts of history and stories like King David, Solomon, Moses, Abraham, minor prophets, etc. On a spiritual level, growing up with these stories really gave us a love for the Jewish people and a curiosity about learning their culture. On a cultural level, we sympathized a lot with the Jewish people, because of what my own people went through in the 1500s (Aztecs) exterminating 95% of our population from 30 Million to just about 2 or 3. My grandmother is one of the few remaining indigenous Aztecs, but aside from my immediate grandmother, for several generations now we have been intermixed in Mexico. For this reason, we grew up with a special appreciation for the Jewish people and supported their right to exist as a race and to have a nation they can call home. All of our lives we have also wanted to visit the Holy Land to experience Israel and this past year both my father and I finally got the opportunity. It brought a lot of the old testaments stories we grew up with to life and it made us love learning about the Jewish culture even more.

Introduction: 

When I first came to Penn, the first community that reached out to me was the Jewish community (which I thought was serendipitous!). This meant a lot to me, because this was my first time being so far away from home and I didn’t really make any friends my first semester in Philly. There was an individual that befriended me through one of the PhD events I went to last semester and invited me to a Shabbat dinner for the first time. He also took it as an opportunity to introduce me to his close-knit circle of friends at Shabbat. Little did I know they would become my closest circle of friends at Penn to date, and since then, we’ve all tried to frequent as much of the Hillel Grad and Jewish Grad Network events together as we can. I felt as though I were adopted by such a wonderful community and they became my new family away from home.
