Our package, NLP_Nitro, provides python-based software to automatically "complexify" any provided text. Specifically, this package includes a GUI that allows the user to type in any arbitrary English text. The GUI will then return a complexified version of the text, where all non-comparator adjectives, singular non-pronoun nouns, adverbs, and verbs are replaced by synonyms of similar meaning and higher complexity.
