<!-- &emsp;&emsp;I am a 3rd-year CS PhD Student studying Natural Language Processing at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/). -->

<!-- &emsp;&emsp;I am so very proud to have [Dr. Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/) as my advisor from the School of Engineering and Applied Science and [Dr. Emily Falk](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/faculty/emily-falk-phd) as my collaborator advisor from the school of Annenberg for Communication.  --> 

<!-- Daughter to Mexican immigrants of indigenous-Aztec descent, I am a 1st-generation U.S. Citizen, the first in my family to be attending University, and the first woman to be educated in our family in over 4 generations (that we have record for). and worked in the private sector for 7 years-->  

&emsp;&emsp;I would like to take a brief moment to acknowledge my mentors and letter writers: [Dr. Benjamin Martin](https://www.txstate.edu/chemistry/people/faculty-alpha/martin.html) from [Texas State University](https://www.txstate.edu/) in San Marcos, TX and [Dr. Robin L. Garrell](https://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/directory/garrell-robin-l) from [University of California at Los Angeles](http://www.ucla.edu/).  Without their dedication and support, my path to graduate school would not have been possible.  I am also an [NSF GRFP Fellow](https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/grfp/AwardeeList.do?method=loadAwardeeList) and could not have had this 2nd-lease on life without the financial resources and support of the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?WT.z_pims_id=6201&ods_key=nsf18573).  I am a 1st-generation Mexican-American. Before joining Penn, I grew up and finished school in Austin, TX with a BSc. in Chemistry and have 7 years of work experience in both government/private sector (KEEP AUSTIN WEIRD!!!).

&emsp;&emsp;My decision to cross over from Chemistry to pursue Computer Science came about at one of my prior places of employment where I was introduced to Data Analytics using SQL while working for a Start-up company.  I worked with large data sets and maintained their database to bring formula/pathogen traceability to their finished product when I had no formal SQL or Database training. I found fulfillment in Data Analytics and it brought purpose to where I was once feeling a lack of job satisfaction before.  From this moment on, I knew I wanted to dedicate the rest of my life to Computer Science.
