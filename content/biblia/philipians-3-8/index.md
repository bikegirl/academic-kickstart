"But whatever former things were gains to me [as I thought 

then], these things [once regarded as advancements in merit] I 

have come to consider as loss [absolutely worthless] for the sake

of Christ [and the purpose which He has given my life]. But more 

than that, I count everything as loss compared to the priceless

privilege and supreme advantage of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord 

[and of growing more deeply and thoroughly acquainted with Him

â€”a joy unequaled]. For His sake I have lost everything, and I 

consider it all rubbish, so that I may gain Christ, and may be 

found in Him [believing and relying on Him], not having any 

righteousness of my own derived from [my obedience to] the Law 

and its rituals, but [possessing] that [genuine righteousness] which 

comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from 

God on the basis of faith. And this, so that I may know Him 

[experientially, becoming more thoroughly acquainted with Him, 

understanding the remarkable wonders of His Person more completely] 

and [in that same way experience] the power of His resurrection 

[which overflows and is active in believers], and [that I may 

share] the fellowship of His sufferings, by being continually conformed 

[inwardly into His likeness even] to His death [dying as He did]; 

so that I may attain to the resurrection 

[that will raise me] from the dead."
