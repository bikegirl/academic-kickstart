"But whatever former things were gains to me [as I thought 
then], these things [once regarded as advancements in merit] I 
have come to consider as loss [absolutely worthless] for the sake
of Christ [and the purpose which He has given my life]. But more 
than that, I count everything as loss compared to the priceless
privilege and supreme advantage of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord 
[and of growing more deeply and thoroughly acquainted with Him
â€”a joy unequaled]. For His sake I have lost everything, and I 
consider it all rubbish, so that I may gain Christ, and may be 
found in Him [believing and relying on Him], not having any 
righteousness of my own derived from [my obedience to] the Law 
and its rituals, but [possessing] that [genuine righteousness] which 
comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from 
God on the basis of faith. And this, so that I may know Him 
[experientially, becoming more thoroughly acquainted with Him, 
understanding the remarkable wonders of His Person more completely] 
and [in that same way experience] the power of His resurrection 
[which overflows and is active in believers], and [that I may 
share] the fellowship of His sufferings, by being continually conformed 
[inwardly into His likeness even] to His death [dying as He did]; 
so that I may attain to the resurrection 
[that will raise me] from the dead."
