The story of the privileged boy...




"And someone came to Him and said, “Teacher, what [essentially] good thing 
shall I do to obtain eternal life [that is, eternal salvation in the Messiah’s kingdom]?” 

Jesus answered, “Why are you asking Me about what is [essentially] good? 
There is only One who is [essentially] good; but if you wish to enter into 
eternal life, keep the commandments.” 

He said to Jesus, “Which commandments?” 

And Jesus answered, 

- “You shall not commit murder; 
- You shall not commit adultery; 
- You shall not steal; 
- You shall not give false testimony; 
- Honor your father and mother; 
- and love your neighbor as yourself” [that is, unselfishly seek the best or higher good for others]. 


The young man said to Him, “I have kept all these things [from my youth]; 
what do I still lack?” 

Jesus answered him, “If you wish to be perfect [that is, have the spiritual maturity 
that accompanies godly character with no moral or ethical deficiencies], go and sell 
what you have and give [the money] to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; 
Then, come, follow Me [becoming My disciple, believing and trusting in Me and walking the same path of life that I walk].” 

But when the young man heard this, he left grieving and distressed, for he owned much property and had many possessions [which he treasured more than his relationship with God].

Jesus said to His disciples, 

“I assure you and most solemnly say to you, 
it is difficult for a rich man [who clings to possessions and status as security] to enter the kingdom of heaven. 
Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, 
than for a rich man [who places his faith in wealth and status] to enter the kingdom of God.” 

When the disciples heard this, they were completely astonished and bewildered, saying, “Then who can be saved [from the wrath of God]?” But Jesus looked at them and said, “With people [as far as it depends on them] it is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”
