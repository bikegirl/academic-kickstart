Everything with a Place and a Purpose
^1 Mortals make elaborate plans,
but God has the last word.
^2 Humans are satisfied with whatever looks good;
God probes for what is good.
^3 Put God in charge of your work,
then what you’ve planned will take place.
^4 God made everything with a place and purpose;
even the wicked are included—but for judgment.
^5 God can’t stomach arrogance or pretense;
believe me, he’ll put those upstarts in their place.
^6 Guilt is banished through love and truth;
Fear-of-God deflects evil.
^7 When God approves of your life,
even your enemies will end up shaking your hand.
^8 Far better to be right and poor
than to be wrong and rich.
^9 We plan the way we want to live,
but only God makes us able to live it.
